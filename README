__Usage__
High-precision, low sample rate (<3kHz), DC coupled USB analog converter. Essentially a "sound card" suitable for biosignal applications (EEG), digital radios, optical sensors, hobby electronics, and other high dynamic range measurements.

BNC Connector accepts +/-8Vin. USB outputs the value according to a sample rate and format specified in firmware, by default, 100Hz @ S32_LE. LED indicator idenfities healthy startup and input overload.

__Firmware__
In the arduino IDE, set Tools --> Board --> Arduino Leonardo . Using an AVR programmer (eg. https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9825 ), either upload the leonardo bootloader or the sketch. Uploading the bootloader allows programming and serial debugging directly over USB.

__Design__
The LTC2440's input range includes floating voltages from 0.5*Vcc to -0.5Vcc. However, ESD protection circuitry rejects inputs referenced to, and below, other grounds on the chip. Carefully designed low-noise biasing circuitry negates this problem.

Board layout is critical. Neighboring digital cirucits introudce high-amplitude high-frequency noise, which is then subject to stray rectification in analog circuits. Further, the LTC2440's switched capacitor inputs introduce high frequency noise, requiring immediate decoupling.

Firmware includes code for sharp, highly efficient IIR low pass filtering. High-frequency noise may be greatly reduced with little effect on the passband.

USA companies provide all parts in these schematics.

__Safety__
USB ports are typically unfused (despite specifications to the contrary). Better to preform smoke testing with a USB wall charger, rather than an expensive computer.

Device does not offer line isolation.

_Testing_
This particular version improves noise problems encountered with the previous version. A previous version was operational,
